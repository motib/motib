Guide to my repositories

## Mathematics

`surprises` The source code for my open access book *Mathematical Surprises*, Springer, 2022. The Hebrew translation also includes the PDF.

`probability-mosteller` This is a "reworking" of the delightful book *Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability and Their Solutions* by Frederick Mosteller. English and Hebrew.

`bagrut` Complete and detailed solutions of the Israeli Matriculation Exams in Mathematics 806/581 for the years 2014-2018. A separate documents contains the solutions of the problems in probability from 2014-2022. Hebrew.

`mathematics` Learning materials primarily for secondary-school mathematics.

`constructions` The document "Surprising Geometric Constructions". This material has been folded in *Mathematical Surprises* and the repository is deprecated.

## Robotics

`elements-of-robotics` The source code for *Elements of Robotics*, Springer, 2018, co-author Francesco Mondada.

`thymio` Source code in Aseba and Python for the Thymio robot including implementations of the algorithms in *Elements of Robotics*. There are also tutorials and simulations in Scratch.

## Mathematical Logic for Computer Science

`LearnSAT` A SAT solver for teaching that implements the DPLL algorithm with CDCL and NCB. Extensive, customizable and visual logging enables students to careful following the algorithms. Written in SWI Prolog.

`mathematical-logic` Implementations in Prolog of algorithms from *Mathematical Logic for Computer Science (Third Edition)*, Springer, 2012.

## Concurrent Programming

`principles-spin` Implementation in Promela of algorithms from *Principles of the Spin Model Checker*, Springer, 2008.

`erigone` A Spin-compatible model check for teaching. Implements a subset of Promela and provides tracing and output display for students.

`jspin` A GUI for running the Spin Model Checker.

`ada-software-engineers` Source code for the programs and quizzes in *Ada for Software Engineers (Second Edition with Ada 2005)*, Springer, 2009.
   
`concurrent-distributed` Source code for the programs in *Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming (Second Edition)*, Addison-Wesley (Pearson), 2006. 

`daj` "Distributed Algorithms in Java" is a software tool for interactively running distributed algorithms. Implementations of fourteen algorithms are included such as the Byzantine Generals and the Chandy-Lamport algorithm for global snapshots.

`jbaci` A simulator for concurrent programming in both C and Pascal. I regard this as obsolete and deprecated.
