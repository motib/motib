- I am Professor (Emeritus) at the Department of Science Teaching of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

- My research was on computer science education though I am no longer active in this field and am currently interested in mathematics.

- I developed many open-source learning materials and educational software that are available on this GitHub site.

- An overview of the repositories appears in `GUIDE.md` in this repository.
