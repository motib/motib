# Moti Ben-Ari

---

- I am Professor (Emeritus) at the Department of Science Teaching of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

- My research was on computer science education though I am no longer active in this field.

- I developed many open-source learning materials and educational software, first in computer science and now in mathematics.

- The documents are in LaTeX and the Hebrew documents use XeLaTeX. The software was written in various languages.

- An overview of the repositories appears in `GUIDE.md` in this repository.
